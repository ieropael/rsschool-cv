### About myself

I am a Bachelor of Jurisprudence, but more recently programming has become my main interest, in particular web development. My goal is to become a full stack developer, but first, I want to fully explore the field of front-end development.

Every day I learn something new from this area and my interest is constantly growing. When teaching, I try to understand each aspect in as much detail as possible. In addition, I study the best practices and decency rules in advance to keep my code lightweight and easy to read.


### Skills

* **HTML**
* **CSS**
* **JavaScript**
* **Pug**
* **Sass**
* **Git**
* **Webpack**
* **BEM**


### Example of code

```
function greet() {
return "Hello World!";
}
```
